<p>I've worked with this model myself in my two previous startups. It works great - if you nail it. The main difference is that you need to put in a lot more work into finding out which customers that will bring you the most $$$ and focus your marketing and sales efforts on acquiring those. Especially if you're planning on providing a marketplace-like service/platform where you might be interested in taking commission on each sale.
